# Kernel Webauthn App

This project is a minimal setup for a full-stack application with WebAuthn using React, TypeScript, and Vite for the frontend, with a Bun-powered backend.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/)

## Installation

To set up the project, clone the repository and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
bun install
```

## Running the Application

The application consists of two main parts: the server and the client.

### Server

To start the server, run the following command:
```bash
bun run server.ts
```
This will start the backend server on the default port.

### Client

To start the client development server, use:
```bash
bun run dev
```
